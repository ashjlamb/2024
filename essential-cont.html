            <p>
        There are many essentials required in going off the grid. Lets look at some of those essentials: <br>
            </p>
            <p>
     Power Generation System<br>
     Off grid power is where the power is generated by yourself in one way or another. This means having a power generation system with backups that <br>
     can run all of your eletricity you need to run all of you electrical items. There are several renewable power energy options. The two most popular <br>
     are solar and wind. 
        </p>
        <p>
    Power Storage System:<br>
    During the day you will be generating energy, but at night or if the wind stops blowing you will need somewhere to have stored energy. You will need to<br>
    purchase batteries that are intended for this use. They are not cheap. You will also need a battery bank and storage system, witha charge controller, inverter, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
           Heating and Cooling:<br>
           Heating and cooling the off grid home will tie into your power generation and are essential things to consider when planning. A wood stove is a popular off grid <br>
           option for heating and cooking. Passive heating and cooling is a great way to regulare the temperature of your off grid home without draining your power source. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Waste Disposal and Septic System:<br>
            You will need some sort of composting waste disposal system or a traditional septic system. Composting toilets are highly efficient and therefore are a great investment.
