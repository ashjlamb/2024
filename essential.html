        There are many essentials required in going off the grid. Lets look at some of those essentials: <br>
            </p>
            <p>
    Land: This is the foundation of your off grid life. It will need to be in a remote area without strict building codes and permitting regulations.<br>
    Key things to look for: Access to water, soil quality, sun exposure, legal requirements, access/proximity to town.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
    Shelter: The next most important thing is your shelter. Its best to have this built before going off the grid. Off grid shelters come in many forms - <br>
    cabins, traditional wood-frame homes, tiny houses, cob houses, Earthships, strawbale homes, or even yurts, which are basically large octagonal-shaped tents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water & Water Collection System:<br>
            Clean water is essential when going off grid and you will not have access to city water. Choosing a piece of land with it's own water source is crutial.<br>\
            You will also need a way to collect the water and building a water collection system would be the best way to go about this. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Food:<br>
            Living off grid means living as self-sufficiently as possible. Creating your own food source will be one of the more demanding tasks living off grid. <br>
            It is wise to have a garden, including some raised beds, and a greenhouse. Meat can be produced as well if you have it setup for livestock.
